I'm really enamored of [_Hypnospace Outlaw_][hypnospace-url]. It's a remarkable aesthetic achievement of a video game, one that could certainly be said to traffic in an exceptionally crafted nostalgia for the visual and cultural palette of the '90s internet; but laudable as even that work would be on its own, it goes further to talk to us about the creation and use of public space. The recreated interfaces of the earlier internet era become a rich mechanism for exploring the intersection of its characters' personal lives with their common shared spaces.

The game takes place via the fictional HypnOS operating system, which gives you all the interface one could reasonbly expect of an OS from that time: email, a web browser, a file browser, and virtual pets. The introductory videos are visciously precise parodies of attempts to humanize new consumer technology that were common at the time and still available to experience in corporate training videos. The player is in the role of a "Hypnospace Enforcer," and the detective-work style of gameplay is gently introduced in the form of tasks that involve seeking out and flagging content that violates copyright. These tasks are a skeleton of structure that nudges you to explore through the content available on the internet pastiche that makes up the main corpus of the game. The style of exploration owes an obvious debt to classics of the detective genre like [_Her Story_][her-story-url] and [_A Mind Forever Voyaging_][mind-forever-url]. Just as an example, later in the game the player can see a record of which pages they have found and which remain, a mechanism that instantly reminded me of _Her Story_. A game like this lives and dies on how much fun its world is to explore. _Hypnospace Outlaw_, to me, succeeds remarkably here.

# Yowza, Aesthetics!

The internet era taken as inspiration by _Hypnospace Outlaw_ is the one in which I had my formative online experiences. The dopamine pings of recognition were frequent and sometimes overwhelming. Numerous genres of early web page are faithfully recreated in detail: clumsily applied templates, genre catalogs, empty corporate pages, scams, hypertext experiments, opaque private portals, and the many many raw nerves of personal expression materialized in web page form. The majority of these pages come in unique formats, bespoke created by their maintainers. Immediately this contrasts with our current content paradigms, where the idea of a single collection of static personal content is almost unheard of. Photos collect on social media platforms, text goes on blogs, art goes on portfolios (maybe the closest I can think of to something like old personal web pages). As ubiquitous as "blog" at one point seemed and as quaint as it is now, I recall when the term was new and the purveyors of "Everything/Nothing" sites, themselves a slight formalization of the bespoke personal website, decried blogs as a slightening of the form; a rote, pallid imitation of real sites. Custom website design of this type often meant two things: first, information and media would be laid out in a dense format, with little room given over to structure and organization. Second, since every page required some overhead of work to build, new content tended to appear slowly. Whether consciously or as a product of the challenge of building an entire community's worth of pages, _Hypnospace Outlaw_ nails this dynamic of dense personally curated information sources spread sparsely across the world.

The dynamism we associate with today's social media was years off when these types of pages were being created, and another style of web usage that shows up in _Hypnospace Outlaw_, to heartbreaking effect, is static pages used for personal communication. Characters create static pages and put content on their pages for each other. The web had yet to fully define its own expressive vocabulary, and direct metaphors to other media were far more common. To create a web page for someone was to send a letter or a card, with a similarly unmediated usage of the raw materials at hand (html and whatever images would reasonably load) as with physical writing and drawing. Of course, the ability to send private letters was perfectly familiar and available then via e-mail, and direct chatting is referenced in the game via a "Chit-Chat" program that we see screenshots from but are never allowed to use. Though we have the kind of voyeuristic access required to find "Sandy Cards" created for specific other characters, there are some privacy boundaries we cannot cross. This is fine. Chat and email are familiar, boring modes to us even now. Sandy Cards are something different. Perhaps their public availability is meant as a reflection of Sandy's age and associated lack of technological prowess. I do not believe there are direct links to them anywhere in the game. They can be found by searching the right keywords. They would have been created and sent directly to their intended recipients. But the mode of expression provided by static web pages creates another possibility. We tend to conceive pages on the internet as containers for specific information, and they have always served at least that function, but prior to the comparmentalization of personal presence to social media, one's web page served as both a data container and one's personal presence in the community of the web. In this mode, to create a page "for" someone and "give" it to them is to create an expression of a caring aspect of oneself. It can be public or private, but it is not a secret. Rather, it is an extension of the personal expression of web pages, one that says part of who you are is defined by caring for others in this community.

![Sandy :(][sandy-card-url]

I will say here that Sandy's inclusion of Gumshoe Gooper on her page "for Abby" hit me so hard in the sincerity that I tweeted that I didn't know if I could progress in the game if it meant I had to flag it for content violation.

The game is full of touches like this, where the freedom of exploring a new medium is reflected in the creative choices of the characters. Phaedrala's "Adopt a Dragon" page, encouraging others to place dragons she draws and describes on their pages, is another way in which creative personal expression is broadened to include the surrounding community.

![Adopt A Dragon][adopt-a-dragon-url]

The meditative hypertext journeys and choose your own adventure horror stories of other characters reflect the insistent metaphors of instant transportation and structural complexity that felt so new at the time. Along with the more standard pages of helpful information, art, music, and opinions, it creates a picture of a moment when the web offered a possibility of a world where creators were less alienated from the presentation of their work. The commodification of art of course preceeds the web by a few... centuries? If we're talking about Marxist theory of labor alienation, let us say that it was probably going strong when Marx was writing. The game in fact includes multiple parodies of such commodification, to great comic effect. Regardless, a deep affection for this personal mode of web creation on the part of the game designers and artists seems obvious. Though they populate their world with a majority of truly awful art and music, and would completely destroy the vérité if they didn't, it all remains charming and satisfying to explore.

That pleasure in exploration is a testament to the skill obviously put into this game. The personal relationships of the characters wind together and cross-reference like secret passages. The feeling one gets from digging through these relationships I can only compare to the joy of St. Louis' [City Museum][city-museum-url]. The wish one has as a child, of a world of mysteries to explore and live in, finally made manifest. Perhaps the game will not invoke that feeling so viscerally in someone who did not experience its aesthetic inspiration directly as I did. For such a person I could still endorse it on the strength of its music alone. There is a lot of music in this game. I'd be remiss to not mention nods to historical web music in its references to the midi and mod tracker scenes, but even without enjoying that reference, the music, autoplaying on almost every page naturally, is by turns good, appropriately bad, goofy, and embarassingly precise (I hope my mod tracker files haven't lived on anywhere).

# What about Identity and Community, Huh?
Through the interaction of its characters and their websites, _Hypnospace Outlaw_ reveals itself as a game interested in the issues of community and identity and the particular performative texts of the early web genre. Virtual spaces have long carried the dream of freeing their denizens from the socially imposed identities they are saddled with in meatspace. Time and the increased relevance of internet presense in our daily lives has jaded us somewhat to this possibility, but in the era of the game, it was still possible to maintain some utopian expectation of new communities built with the biases of racism, misogyny, ageism, homophobia, et al. _Hypnospace Outlaw_'s creators obviously know better than to entertain this illusion, but its more high-minded characters would not necessarily. We see them form communities around shared interests, but we also see them partition themselves (and be partitioned) along some traditional lines, particularly in the game into categories of age. Still, we see some of the bleeding across age boundaries and the culture shock of radically different groups interacting that could be the halmark of the web's fluidity and elision of common identity markers. The "Dumpster" page in the game, dedicated to mocking other pages, rings remarkably true to me as something that was common in the time of more personal page building: clever youth or young adults flexing their worldliness to fill bullying roles, shocking adults by putting everyone in the same category of target for their sophomoric jabs; but at the same time being a kind of negative affirmation of the tightness of this community, relying on their audience's base level of familiarity with the targets.

I have to wonder if the explicit attention to age differences in the game is reflective of the specific experiences of the authors. It felt very reminiscent of my own experience as a young person on the internet: punching above my weight, mixing it up with more sophisticated peers, the high of having fooled people into thinking I was older. But youth is, of course, an identity from which we are desperate to escape. The main project of youth is to become an adult, to try on identities. The web, then as now, is nothing if not a place to explore the possibilities of doing so. What about the identities that are not so easy to shrug off? Race, gender, sexuality, and disability are fraught with histories of juridical enforcement. Eventually age returns to have its revenge in this form as well. Indeed, the specifically older characters of the game seem lost and fearful, engaged in community building on a platform that they suspect, perhaps not inaccurately, to be hostile toward them. Of course, they are no less absurd and petty than the other characters, and eventually their squabbles push away the kindest and most empathetic of them.

The issue of race on the web and in _Hypnospace Outlaw_ was what initially inspired me to organize my thoughts about the game. Its portrayal of the web matches my memories so precisely, but at some point the positionality of my memories started to bother me. I occupy about every category of privilage one can have in America, notably here that I am a white male of middle class upbringing. The web I've experienced has been majority white, male, and middle class. This is, of course, the lie that time has put to the dreams of the web as a venue for freely constructed identity and community. Broadening the scope of who I listen to has informed me that there have long been specifically non-white communities on the web as well, [BlackPlanet][black-planet-url] being a particularly well known example. Of course, the web communities I participated in were not specifically white, they were just default, which it turns out mostly means white, and to a slightly lesser extent, mostly means male. The characters of _Hypnospace Outlaw_, too, are mostly white and male. They are not univerally, though, and in fact it was the inclusion of a black woman's page that made me consider the whiteness of the internet it was recalling for me at all. There are a significant number of women in the game (though I did not make an audit of the ratios), and it explicitly integrates the harrassment and active marginalization common for women on the web into its plot. Though I'll defer to women to analyze their representation in the game, it feels like the creators wrote these stories with an understanding of how traditional biases and role policing transpose to these new communities.

As another example of the game's quality of characterization, it was a particular woman in the game, Linda, who started me thinking about the aesthetics and structure of personal presentation discussed above. I felt like I had known this woman, and it made me wonder how such a person would express their rich individuality and nerdiness using the tools available today. Thinking of the people I know who collect and create strange art similar to Linda made me realize how compartmentalized our personal representation tools now are.

![Linda is weird][linda-url]

These characters, and particularly the marginalized ones, give the game, to me, an overarching theme of loneliness. The question of representation in the game is complex. Tamara, a young black poet, is one of the only people of color we are shown in the game, though we are given textual descriptions of others. Is this a failure of _Hypnospace Outlaw_ to fairly represent the communities of web users of this time? I'm not sure. Tamara **is** lonely in the game, and imagining a young black woman trying to find peers on the web I grew up with, this seems appropriate. You feel for her, want something better than the infighting, petty mess comprising most of the game's communities, and not just because her poetry seems to carry more weight and promise than most other characters' creations.

![Tamara Looking for Community][tamara-url]

Her searching for community as the game progresses feels like a meta-highlight of the default whiteness we (I certainly) often casually ascribe to the web then and now. I would love to know what the creators' thoughts were about representation as they were writing these characters. I'd be remiss here to not note again that my critical eye on this topic is somewhat limited as a white person, and that the three credited creators of the game do in fact include a person of color, so their collective perspective on this is inevitably broader than my own. (Noting however that it is not in fact any person of color's job to ensure the non-homogenaity of narratives produced by white creators.)

# Platform Stewardship
If _Hypnospace Outlaw_ has a specific political concern, it is the issue of technological social platforms and the impact their stewardship has on their citizens. This issue of course looms large in our contemporary lives. I would say it was a lucky coincidence for the game to come out in such close proximity to the announcement that [Myspace lost its music archives][myspace-news-url] or [Facebook storing user passwords in plaintext][facebook-pw-url], but catastrophes of this type have become a regular occurrance. Beyond techical stewardship, platform owners' disinterest in and failure to monitor or control content broadcast with their technology has led to unchecked usage for heinous purposes such as [organizing white supremacist terrorism][twitter-white-supremacy-url] and [inciting genocide in Myanmar][fb-genocide-url].

You are brought into the game's world as a content enforcer on the Hypnospace platform. You are given categories of behavior to suppress, including harrassment and illegal activity, but tellingly your early tasks center around copyright infringement and commerce that competes with Hypnospace's proprietary currency. Despite predictable techno-utopian language from its founders, HypnOS is, like Facebook and Twitter, primarily concerned with its status as a business entity. This manifests not just in direct responses to legal threats or competition, but even to satisfy the founders' petty concerns about what they believe will project a successful image. One of the early conflicts between HypnOS and its users involves the restructuring of multiple "nerd"-centric domains into one catchall domain, to help create the impression that the service is for everyone, not just these nerds. This kind of governance decision, in the game and in real life, highlights the difference between users as computing _citizens_ and computing _consumers_. This distinction is drawn, and heavily discussed, in [_A People's History of Computing_][peoples-history-url]. When the responsibility of platforms to their users is mediated as a responsibility to keep extracting payment from those users (as it **must** be for any business that depends on that payment), that payment becomes the only intrinsic value of each user. All moral precepts of the common space must derive either from this monetary value or from the whims of the platform owners. _Hypnospace Outlaw_ casts a harsh glare on the latter as well. The boy king of HypnOS, Dylan Mechant, flatters himself as a brilliant pioneer of this new social venue, but reveals his solipsism and incompetence at every difficult turn. The conflict between Dyland and Roddy, another HypnOS programmer with stronger alliances to the nerdy social groups of the platform, reveals whatever ethical sophistication the platform contains to be the product of cronyistic in-fighting among excitable young men. The game gives us a comical and even pettier projection of the leader dynamic in how Gil; leader of the new, ostensibly self-governed nerd domain; quickly becomes a style dictator based on his own sub-fanfic aesthetics.

Without revealing too much of the game's later mysteries, even the actual "resistence" against HypnOS is formed and has ethical guidance strictly as a reflection of the contrarian impulses of its de-facto leader. Without inherent precepts of citizen rights and value, this kind of anarchic resistance becomes the only available check on the business-driven actions of the platform owners. In the end, this becomes a question of physical safety for HypnOS's users, and even the stated and to different degrees felt moral standards of its owners cannot stand against the inevitability of the central ethical driver of money. I will leave it to players to discover the way this affects HypnOS in the game, but we see the result in real life when even compromising the safety of its users is not enough to threaten a platform's dominance of our social spaces. Facebook and Twitter have allowed their platforms to facilitate targetting violence against their users. They have leveraged their platforms' dominance to extract privacy concessions from users which would, were users availed of freer choices, be impossible. A recent [memo to the Federal Trade Commission][facebook-memo-url] by the House's head of anti-trust policy, David Cicilline, lays out these abrogations of user rights as a legal case against Facebook for exercising monopoly power. Legal Scholar Lena Khan makes a [similar case][amazon-monopoly-url] in reference to Amazon's dominance of the online vendor market.

This is all to say that _Hypnospace Outlaw_ gives one a lot to think about, but not in a mealy-mouthed way of presenting "complexities" of an issue without revealing its own ethical stance, nor as a simple, dull polemic. Instead, it reaches that great ability that art has of showing us something deep and real without telling us how it does it. The craft of its world and characters steps beyond rote to obtain as something we can briefly experience and exit with a richer vision of our lived reality. It is truly wonderful.
